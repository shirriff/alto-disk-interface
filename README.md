# A Diablo disk emulator for use with a Xerox Alto

Note: This is still under development and is not working yet

The concept is a small box that you can plug into the Alto's disk interface, replacing the Diablo disk. The box will emulate the disk drive,
using a disk image from a SD card.

The hardware design is in the interface directory. It is based on a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and uses a LCD touch screen as the user interface.

The driver software is in the TestApp directory.
